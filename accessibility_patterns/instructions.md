# Instructions for Accessibility Pattern
Hello! Glad you have made it this far into the process for the Accessibility Solutions position.

Estimated time to complete: 1 hour

## The Assignment
Create an accessible code component pattern, demo, and guided discussion of how it meets both WCAG standards and real user expectations. You will be required to feature at least some interactive elements such as links, buttons with actions, disclosure or progressive display patterns, or other common patterns that frequently fail accessibility testing and assistive technology evaluation. Be prepared to discuss the minutia of WAI-ARIA choices, semantic or non-semantic structure, and modifications using javascript. 

Examples include (but are not limited to):
- main website navigation
- sub navigations or in-page navigation patterns for long form content
- filtering, sorting, or state-related interactions with on-screen content
- components or elements that allow for the disclosure of additional information (accordions, dropdowns, buttons, checkboxes)
- any combination of elements to form a complex display that would require thoughtful accessibility engineering to provide equal access

The main purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to create accessible front-end code patterns that will be both WCAG 2.2 AA conformant as well as usable by real people and assistive technology & adjacents. 

Keep at the forefront our real, disabled users and how they interact with websites and digital content. Sometimes our job is to educate developers, architects, content editors, and non-technical people about barriers to access and the experience of disabled users with technology. 

## Guidelines
- This is an accessibility engineering exercise, not a design one. You will be evaluated on the effort and thought put into accessibility choices and code patterns, not on your ability to create a standalone, polished display (do your best!).
- Please do not just copy and paste code from a pattern library and annotate. This is about creating patterns that are accessible, as we are frequently asked to remediate, evaluate, and create conformant code patterns that might not be boilerplate elsewhere. 
- Indicate which screen readers, OS's, and devices you tested on.

## What to submit in your pull request
- A well-formatted and creative solution that can be as simple as some html, css, and javascript. 
- Organized code, with explanations and notations as necessary.
- A functional demo that can be used during a live demonstration.
- Try to avoid PDFs and word documents, unless very helpful or necessary. 
- What you submit will be the basis of our evaluation and will serve as what you will present and lead a discussion on for your final interview.

# this-is-not-a-test
For job exercise submissions. 

## Hello World!
Thank you for applying to work for the New York State Digital Service! This is the repository where you will submit your candidate evaluation exercise responses. 

## Rules & Guidelines
- Please do not use AI tools, Copilot, ChatGPT or any other AI adjacent helpers. Why? This exercise is to evaluate YOUR abilities, not your ability to use AI to assist. 
- This is a best effort exercise: we do not expect perfection, nor will we be critiquing every line of code or approach.
- There are many, many, many correct ways to do these things. Please be creative and be ready to explain your methods.
- This repo is contained within an Official New York State GitHub organization, is open to the public, and is public domain. 
- Do not submit PRs that contain: private keys, environment variables, proprietary information or code, copyrighted material, or anything you wouldn't want the entire internet to be able to have access to, as these will be rejected. 

## Process
- For your submissions please fork this repo, create a branch with your name and which exercise (a11y-audit, a11y-patterns, build-your-own-component, choose-your-own-adventure-code-demo), and then submit a PR to merge your repo into the branch for the job you are applying for (either accessibility-solutions or web-solutions branches).
- Example: candidate-name-a11y-audit --> merge into --> accessibility-solutions 
- Please organize your code into the folders provided for the exercises and into a top level folder with your name.
- Example: accessibility_audit/candidate-name/(things here!)

## Exercises to Choose from for Accessibility Solutions:
1. Accessibility audit of the homepage of any New York State website, using WCAG 2.2 AA.
- This does not need to be exahustive. Since we are ruling out using automated tools, do your best to critique, evaluate, and demonstrate your ability to perform an accessibility

2. Create an accessibile code pattern
- 

## Exercises to Choose from for Web Solutions:
1. Build a component from a NYS website with entirely your own code
- examples: 

2. Choose your own adventure code demo of your choice

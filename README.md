# this-is-not-a-test 
For job exercise submissions. Don't panic!

## Hello World!
Thank you for applying to work for the New York State Digital Service! This is the repository where you will submit your candidate evaluation exercise responses. 

## Rules & Guidelines
- Please do not use AI, Copilot, ChatGPT or any other AI adjacent helpers. Why? This exercise is to evaluate YOUR abilities, not your ability to use AI to assist. 
- This is a best effort exercise: we do not expect perfection, nor will we be critiquing every line of code or approach.
- There are many, many, many correct ways to do these things. Please be creative and be ready to explain your methods.
- This repo is contained within an Official New York State GitHub organization, is open to the public, and is public domain. 
- Do not submit PRs that contain: private keys, environment variables, proprietary information or code, copyrighted material, or anything you wouldn't want the entire internet to be able to have access to, as these will be rejected. 

## Process
- For your submissions please fork this repo, create a branch with your name, and then submit a PR to merge your repo into the branch for the job you are applying for (either accessibility-solutions or web-solutions branches).
- Please organize your code into the folders provided for the exercises and into a top level folder with your name.
- Example PR structure: candidate-name --> merge into --> accessibility-solutions (or web-solutions)
- Example contents: accessibility_audit/candidate-name/(things you did here!)
- For simple text, please use markdown or html, try not to submit pdfs or word documents unless absolutely necessary

# Instructions for Build Your Own Components
Hello! Glad you have made it this far into the process for the Web Solutions position.

Estimated time to complete: 1-2 hours. 

## The Assignment
Pick a few simple - or one more complex - component from a NYS website and rebuild it or improve up with entirely your own code. What constitutes a component? A higher-order collection of simple patterns that forms a distinct section of a page. 

Examples include (but are not limited to):
- Hero *simple*
- Cards and a queue of several card types *moderate*
- Highlight's with buttons or dates *simple*
- Main website navigation *complex*
- Filter display, with checkboxes (does not need to autoload or refresh data on selection) *complex*
- Popular Services tile queue *moderate*
- Some examples are at [Digital Service Sandbox Patterns](https://nys-digital-service.netlify.app/components/) and of course from anywhere within [NY.gov](https://ny.gov)

The main purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to do front-end web development. We work within the constraints of a branding guide and design pattern library, but frequently have to build new patterns with the smaller token pieces of other components, color schemes, and patterns.

## Accessibility Note
Keep at the forefront our real users (disabled users too!) and how they interact with websites and digital content. Sometimes our job is to educate developers, architects, content editors, and non-technical people about barriers to access and the experience of users with technology. 

## Guidelines
- This is a front-end engineering exercise. You will be evaluated primarily on your grasp and use of core web technologies: html, css, and javascript. 
- There's no restriction on using front-end tooling, libraries, dependencies, etc. 
- **Write your own code** It will be clear if copilot made the decisions for you.
- Go ahead and use react or vue or svelte or cool-awesome-cactus-juice-red-blue-team.js, but keep in mind: our development workflows require careful architectural analysis of dependencies, skill sets, and use cases with real users and accessibility at the forefront. Just because people use react, doesn't mean we're going to build everything with it. 
- Please do not just copy and paste code from a pattern library and annotate. This is about creating front-end patterns, as we are frequently asked to remediate, evaluate, and create code patterns that might not be boilerplate elsewhere. 

## What to submit in your pull request
- A well-formatted and creative solution that can be as simple as some html, css, and javascript. 
- Organized code, with explanations and notations as necessary.
- A functional demo that can be used during a live demonstration.
- Try to avoid PDFs and word documents, unless very helpful or necessary. 
- What you submit will be the basis of our evaluation and will serve as what you will present and lead a discussion on for your final interview.
